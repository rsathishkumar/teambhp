Module: AMP Context

Description
===========
Provides a context condition to be used with Context module.
When this module is enabled, it will disable all contexts but
those with AMP context condition. This is useful to easily
remove components/blocks/other integrations from AMP pages.
The global override is optional. If you prefer to use only the
context condition, its fine.

Installation
============
Copy the module directory in to your Drupal:
/sites/all/modules directory as usual.

Clear the caches to make the plugin available.
